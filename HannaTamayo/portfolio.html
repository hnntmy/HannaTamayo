			<p id="information"><font face="verdana" color="white" size = "5x">This Student Management System was made by me and my groupmates last SADSIGN Project. This was proposed for Lynwood Christian Academy to give them much easier work than their usual way of recording their student's information. This was installed last March 2018 to their computers and it helped them alot. </font></p>

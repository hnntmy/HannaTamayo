			<p id="autobiography"><font face="gothic" color="white" size = "5x">My name is Princess Hanna Tamayo Tamayo and I'm from Cainta, Rizal. I'm a bit annoying but I assure you my loyalty in every way. I was born in December 18, 1998 at Mariveles, Bataan. I'm 19 years old, turning 20 this year, of course and I'm taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at STI College OrCa. I live in Blk 10 Lot 26 Jabson Compound San Andres Cainta,Rizal. My mother's name is Lotria Tamayo and my father's name is Jose Tamayo. I have five sisters and they are , Ate Yvette Kristine, Ate Arianne, Ate Jovell at Clarence.  </font></p>

			<p id="autobiography"><font face="gothic" color="white" size = "5x"> I started my college life in CEU (Centro Escolar University) but I dont think that it's fate to study there because of some tragedy that happened in the past but I'm okay now. I'm taking up BSPharmacy when I was still studying there and I can say that being a Pharmacists someday is really my dream but now I'm an IT student so I must love my course for me to get a diploma. I've experienced so many critization about why did I chose to be an IT student instead of being a med student in other school, but they just can't understand. I'm happy on what I'm doing in my life and I'm grateful for having my friends in STI now. I really admire them for being kind and generous. </font></p>
